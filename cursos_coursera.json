Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc. \n\nEsto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.\n\n\nNosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.\n\nEl propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podrán reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teorías en el ámbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tránsito conceptual. De esta manera, los estudiantes analizarán distintos ámbitos de aplicación de dichos modelos y conceptualizaciones en ámbitos de salud, educación y trabajo, comprendiendo una visión integral del desarrollo humano de una sociedad desde el enfoque de derechos humanos.",

The Document AI API is a document understanding solution that takes unstructured data, such as documents and emails, and makes the data easier to understand, analyze, and consume.\n\nIn this lab, you will create a document processing pipeline that will automatically process documents that are uploaded to Cloud Storage. The pipeline consists of a primary Cloud Function that processes new files that are uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Document AI form processor and then saves form data detected in those files to BigQuery. If the form data includes any address fields the address data is then written to a Pub/Sub topic that in turn triggers a second Cloud Function that uses to Geocoding API to provide geographic coordinate data for the address that is also written to BigQuery.\n\nThis is a simple pipeline that uses a general form processor that will detect basic form data, such as a labelled field containing address information. Document AI processors that use one of the specialized parsers that are beyond the scope of this lab provide enhanced entity information for specific document types even when those documents do not include labelled fields. For example, a Document AI Invoice parser can provide detailed address and supplier information, from an unlabelled invoice document because it understands the layout of invoices.",

Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros.

The training is role-based and uses case scenarios.  Also, it has additional, optional modules on other topics of interest or relevance.  Although we suggest to complete the course within a month's timeframe, the course is self-paced and so you can start and finish the course at anytime during a month's time period. No additional hardware or software are required for this course.\n\nOur nation’s healthcare system is changing at a rapid pace. Transformative health care delivery programs depend heavily on health information technology to improve and coordinate care, maintain patient registries, support patient engagement, develop and sustain data infrastructure necessary for multi-payer value-based payment, and enable analytical capacities to inform decision making and streamline reporting.  The accelerated pace of change from new and expanding technology will continue to be a challenge for preparing a skilled workforce so taking this training will help you to stay current in the dynamic landscape of health care.\n\nThis course is one of three related courses in the HI-FIVE training program, which has topics on population health, care coordination and interoperability, value-based care, healthcare data analytics, and patient-centered care.  Each of the three courses is designed from a different perspective based on various healthcare roles.  This first course is from a clinical perspective, geared towards physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, clinical executives and managers, medical assistants, and other clinical support roles.  However, we encourage anyone working in healthcare, health IT, public health, and population health to participate in any of the three trainings.",

This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.",

This means acknowledging and embracing your strengths. It also means understanding and learning to manage your weaknesses. It’s tougher than that sounds. How do you know what your strengths and weaknesses are? What are your core personality attributes? How do you make decisions? What’s your decision-making style? How do you know? How do you know accurately?\n\nThis certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success.\n\nKnowing what you can change and what you can’t is invaluable knowledge. Stop investing in trying to change the unchangeable -- your traits -- and learn to work with them. Stop trying to change others’ traits, too. Learn to work with your strengths, build new skills and perfect existing ones. Then do the same for your team. To start, you must have self-awareness.\n\nYou’ll learn how self-awareness is the super Power Skill, the foundation of all other skills needed to be an effective leader.. They are the most sought-after skills by recruiters and hiring managers. Power skills are key to becoming a great leader.\n\nThe UMD Power Lab includes a curated set of self-assessments offered at a discounted price paid separately from the edX content and certificate. These self-assessments are rigorously developed and cannot be supplemented with free versions that would mislead learners with poor-quality alternatives. The UMD Power Lab is optional but highly recommended for any verified learner in the course. It costs $89 per year and only needs to be purchased once per year for the entire suite of courses in the Re-Imagining Leadership Professional Certificate.\n\nWe've done everything we can to reduce these costs for you, and have built a free SMART Goals Mobile App to help you achieve your goals. Used together this forms a revolutionary design to coach learners at scale in leadership and power skills as a premium but low-cost experience above and beyond learning the course content and earning the edX certificate.",

In this course, we also dealt with the early Korean Neo-Confucianism's gaze on “cheon”, referring to “heaven” as an example that clearly demonstrates the characteristics of Korean philosophy before it was given the name “philosophy.” Even before and after the advent of Neo-Confucianism, the search for ultimate existence – expressed in various terms – was constantly pursued. The gaze on “heaven” is an important feature of Korean philosophy.",

        "descripcion": "This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\n \nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n \nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.",

An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. \n\nTasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \n(1) The excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.\n\n\nIn order to receive academic credit for this course you must successfully pass the academic exam on campus.

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.",

There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nANATOMY OF THE CHEST, NECK, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F.

Este curso busca facilitar la comprensión de cómo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energía eléctrica. \n\nPara desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energéticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector eléctrico (cómo es su estructura, cuáles son sus principales retos, cómo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuáles son sus fundamentos, cómo opera, qué tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razón, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energía como expertos en análisis de datos. \n\nNo es fácil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener también un lenguaje especializado y no es fácil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. \n\nJustamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diálogo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicación. \n\nPara ello, lo que haremos será presentar los elementos básicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos áreas del conocimiento con una perspectiva más amplia que profunda. El propósito es el de adquirir una comprensión de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector eléctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cómo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector eléctrico.\n\n¿Cómo está estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis módulos y en cada uno de esos módulos trabajamos un tema del área de energía y un tema del área de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicación concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicación concreta. En cada módulo, usted encontrará:\n- videos explicativos\n- un laboratorio no calificado\n- un laboratorio calificado\n- un cuestionario calificado.\n\nLos laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sí que tenga algún tipo de experticia en programación. \n\n¿Para quién es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:\n1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energético que quiere explorar qué puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y\n2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cómo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el área del sector energético. Por ej.: Este curso está dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo año interesados en ciencia e ingeniería, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programación.",

The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\n\nAfter completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach.

It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. \n\nThe Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \n\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \n\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete.

This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business’ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.\n\n“Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax.

Integrating mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) with NCD prevention and care might therefore be useful, both to be more effective, and to require fewer resources. There is, however, a lack of widely accepted guidelines that take this into account, and this course is intended to draw attention to that issue.\n\nAttention to NCDs focused initially on four major disease categories (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) and four groups of associated risk factors (unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol). Recently, mental ill-health has been considered as the fifth NCD and environmental determinant as the fifth risk factor for NCDs – known as ‘5-by-5’ conditions. \n\nThe course has a threefold aim: i) to explore evidence of interaction between mental ill-health and other NCDs and the role of psychosocial support in humanitarian response; ii) to explore what is being done and where; what level the determinants of health are being addressed at and the integration of mental health and psychosocial support or MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response; and iii) to identify and explore challenges, opportunities and lessons learned for integrating MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response.\n\nThe MOOC will be led by a course leader from the University of Copenhagen in close collaboration with academic teachers, the Danish Red Cross and IFRC Reference Centre for Psychosocial Support, Copenhagen, Denmark.",

        "descripcion": "La Unión Europea (UE) continúa siendo una de las experiencias más avanzadas de integración económica y unión política a nivel global. Desde sus orígenes en los años 50 del siglo XX, la UE ha expandido significativamente su influencia, y hoy enfrenta una nueva serie de desafíos globales, desde la gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19 hasta las recientes crisis energética y climática, y los efectos de la guerra en Ucrania. Estos desafíos han puesto de relieve la importancia de una respuesta coordinada a nivel europeo, impulsando el desarrollo de políticas comunes en áreas clave como la seguridad energética, la defensa común y la transición hacia una economía verde.\nA pesar de la creciente presión de posiciones críticas y escépticas frente al proceso de integración, la UE sigue siendo un referente crucial para sus ciudadanos. Así lo refleja, por ejemplo, el Eurobarómetro de 2023, en el cual un alto porcentaje de europeos expresó su apoyo a una mayor cooperación en áreas estratégicas como la política exterior, la sostenibilidad energética y la defensa de valores democráticos. Estas cifras resaltan el papel fundamental que la ciudadanía otorga a la UE en un contexto de globalización compleja y en continua transformación.\nFrente a las crecientes contradicciones de un mundo globalizado, entender cómo estos procesos de cesión progresiva de soberanía y coordinación de la toma de decisiones afectan a los ciudadanos europeos constituye uno de los retos más apasionantes para las ciencias políticas, las relaciones internacionales y el análisis de políticas públicas. Este curso, elaborado por la Cátedra Jean Monnet en Políticas Europeas de la UAB y cofinanciado por el Programa Erasmus+ de la UE, tiene como objetivo ofrecer una comprensión profunda del funcionamiento de la UE como un sistema político único. A través de un análisis crítico, el curso explora el origen y evolución de la UE, su diseño institucional y sus principales políticas públicas.\nDirigido a un público amplio, el curso proporciona herramientas para entender cómo se definen e implementan las políticas públicas a nivel europeo y doméstico, cuáles son sus actores principales, y las dinámicas que gobiernan la relación entre las instituciones de la UE y los Estados miembros.\nLos módulos están diseñados para ofrecer una visión integral del proceso de integración europea, partiendo de los hitos históricos más importantes, el rol de cada una de las principales instituciones de la UE y el impacto del derecho europeo en las legislaciones nacionales. Este curso combina la teoría con una perspectiva aplicada, seleccionando algunos de los ámbitos políticos más relevantes para observar la “UE en acción”, tanto a nivel interno (por ejemplo, economía, política agrícola, cohesión y política ambiental), como a nivel externo (la posición internacional de la UE, la cooperación al desarrollo y el comercio exterior, entre otros). Además, el curso analiza el papel de la UE en el contexto actual de tensiones internacionales y sus esfuerzos por fortalecer la seguridad y resiliencia europeas.\nPuedes ver el vídeo promocional del curso en este enlace: https://youtu.be/SnTonWSwuS8",

The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.\n\nThe first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.\n\nThe third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as \"superstition\", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.\n\nThe courses are listed below:\n\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE) \nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368) (To be launched in late 2018)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015) (To be launched in late 2018)",
